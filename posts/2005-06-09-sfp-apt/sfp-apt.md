SFP: Home, Sweet, Home

I started looking for an apartment [as soon as we headed out to
Cambridge for an interview](http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/001679) but
few things had been made available yet. Then [the server
died](http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/whaaaa) and I was distraught for a
while. By the time I started looking again, few things were available
and in the past few weeks things have gotten increasingly desperate.

We went through craigslist and made up a list of options, but each one
seemed to fall apart upon investigation. Occasionally, especially as
deadlines moved closer, I would stumble across an amazing deal and throw
all of my hope into it, convincing myslf that we’d get it and all would
work out fine. These deals repeatedly collapsed, eventually leaving me
where I was this morning: at Stanford, without an apartment or a plane
ticket, and getting kicked out the next morning.

My dad, thankfully, was at MIT this week and he took some time to go
down to the housing office and investigate their options. He discovered
that it was possible to get an MIT dorm room and pay by the night and
suggested I stay there while I figured out a more long-term place to
stay.

I was not looking forward to move out of one dorm room just to move into
another, but then he found that MIT’s [beautiful Simmons
Hall](http://web.mit.edu/evolving/projects/simmons/) (aka the bubble
wrap building — Sean insists “it looks like a Tetris reject”) was
available to stay in. I’d always admired photos of Simmons Hall, thought
of trying to find an excuse to visit, even considered going to MIT
because of it (until I realized that there was little chance I’d get to
stay there). And now I was getting to stay there — apparently we might
even be able to stay there for the whole summer.

So I signed up for a few nights — got an amazingly low room rate — and
bought a plane ticket for tomorrow morning — also surprisingly cheap and
perfect (I thought I’d have to leave out of some obscure airport and
stop in some obscure hub, but it’s direct from SF!). Procrastination
really worked out this time, it seems. Too bad I didn’t get this kind of
peace of mind earlier; then I could have spent the week on the town!
(Although I did have some fun [Segwaying with
Seth](http://vitanuova.loyalty.org/weblog/nb.cgi/view/vitanuova/2005/06/05/0)
and going to dinner with some of Apple’s Safari team…)

Now I just need to finish packing.
