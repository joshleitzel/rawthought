“With all the time you spend watching TV,” he tells me, “you could have
written a novel by now.” It’s hard to disagree with the sentiment —
writing a novel is undoubtedly a better use of time than watching TV —
but what about the hidden assumption? Such comments imply that time is
“fungible” — that time spent watching TV can just as easily be spent
writing a novel. And sadly, that’s just not the case.

Time has various levels of quality. If I’m walking to the subway station
and I’ve forgotten my notebook, then it’s pretty hard for me to write
more than a couple paragraphs. And it’s tough to focus when you keep
getting interrupted. There’s also a mental component: sometimes I feel
happy and motivated and ready to work on something, but other times I
feel so sad and tired I can only watch TV.

If you want to be more productive then, you have to recognize this fact
and deal with it. First, you have to make the best of each kind of time.
And second, you have to try to make your time higher-quality.

Spend time efficiently
----------------------

### Choose good problems

Life is short (or so I’m told) so why waste it doing something dumb?
It’s easy to start working on something because it’s convenient, but you
should always be questioning yourself about it. Is there something more
important you can work on? Why don’t you do that instead? Such questions
are hard to face up to (eventually, if you follow this rule, you’ll have
to ask yourself why you’re not working on the most important problem in
the world) but each little step makes you more productive.

This isn’t to say that all your time should be spent on the most
important problem in the world. Mine certainly isn’t (after all, I’m
writing this essay). But it’s definitely the standard against which I
measure my life.

### Have a bunch of them

Another common myth is that you’ll get more done if you pick one problem
and focus on it exclusively. I find this is hardly ever true. Just this
moment for example, I’m trying to fix my posture, exercise some muscles,
drink some fluids, clean off my desk, IM with my brother, and write this
essay. Over the course the day, I’ve worked on this essay, read a book,
had some food, answered some email, chatted with friends, done some
shopping, worked on a couple other essays, backed up my hard drive, and
organized my book list. In the past week I’ve worked on several
different software projects, read several different books, studied a
couple different programming languages, moved some of my stuff, and so
on.

Having a lot of different projects gives you work for different
qualities of time. Plus, you’ll have other things to work on if you get
stuck or bored (and that can give your mind time to unstick yourself).

It also makes you more creative. Creativity comes from applying things
you learn in other fields to the field you work in. If you have a bunch
of different projects going in different fields, then you have many more
ideas you can apply.

### Make a list

Coming up with a bunch of different things to work on shouldn’t be hard
— most people have tons of stuff they want to get done. But if you try
to keep it all in your head it quickly gets overwhelming. The psychic
pressure of having to remember all of it can make you crazy. The
solution is again simple: write it down.

Once you have a list of all the things you want to do, you can organize
it by kind. For example, my list is programming, writing, thinking,
errands, reading, listening, and watching (in that order).

Most major projects involve a bunch of these different tasks. Writing
this, for example, involves reading about other procrastination systems,
thinking up new sections of the article, cleaning up sentences, emailing
people with questions, and so on, all in addition to the actual work of
writing the text. Each task can go under the appropriate section, so
that you can do it when you have the right kind of time.

#### Integrate the list with your life

Once you have this list, the problem becomes remembering to look at it.
And the best way to remember to look at it is to make looking at it what
you would do anyway. For example, I keep a stack of books on my desk,
with the ones I’m currently reading on top. When I need a book to read,
I just grab the top one off the stack.

I do the same thing with TV/movies. Whenever I hear about a movie I
should watch, I put it in a special folder on my computer. Now whenever
I feel like watching TV, I just open up that folder.

I’ve also thought about some more intrusive ways of doing this. For
example, a web page that pops up with a list of articles in my “to read”
folder whenever I try to check some weblogs. Or maybe even a window that
pops up with work suggestions occasionally for me to see when I’m
goofing off.

Make your time higher quality
-----------------------------

Making the best use of the time you have can only get you so far. The
much more important problem is making more higher quality time for
yourself. Most people’s time is eaten up by things like school and work.
Obviously if you attend one of these, you should stop. But what else can
you do?

### Ease physical constraints

#### Carry pen and paper

Pretty much everyone interesting I know has some sort of pocket notebook
they carry at all times. Pen and paper is immediately useful in all
kinds of circumstances — if you need to write something down for
somebody, take notes on something, scratch down an idea, and so on. I’ve
even written whole articles in the subway.^[1](#fn:sub)^

(I used to do this, but now I just carry my computerphone everywhere. It
doesn’t let me give people information physically, but it makes up for
it by giving me something to read all the time (email) and pushing my
notes straight into my email inbox, where I’m forced to deal with them
right away.)

#### Avoid being interrupted

For tasks that require serious focus, you should avoid getting
interrupted. One simple way is to go somewhere interrupters can’t find
you. Another is to set up an agreement with the people around you:
“don’t bother me when the door is closed” or “IM me if I have headphones
on” (and then you can ignore the IMs until you’re free).

You don’t want to overdo it. Sometimes if you’re really wasting time you
*should* be distracted. It’s a much better use of time to help someone
else with their problem than it is to sit and read the news. That’s why
setting up specific agreements is a good idea: you *can* be interrupted
when you’re not really focusing.

### Ease mental constraints

#### Eat, sleep, exercise

Time when you’re hungry or tired or twitchy is low-quality time.
Improving it is simple: eat, sleep, and exercise. Yet I somehow manage
to screw up even this. I don’t like going to get food, so I’ll often
work right through being hungry and end up so tired out that I can’t
bring myself to go get food.^[2](#fn:t)^

It’s tempting to say to yourself, “I know I’m tired but I can’t take a
nap — I have work to do”. In fact, you’ll be much more productive if you
do take that nap, since you’ll improve the quality of the day’s
remaining time and you were going to have to sleep sometime anyway.

I don’t really exercise much so I’m probably not the best person to give
advice on that bit, but I do try to work it in where I can. While I’m
lying down reading, I do situps. And when I need to go somewhere on
foot, I run.

#### Talk to cheerful people

Easing mental constraints is much harder. One thing that helps is having
friends who are cheerful. For example, I always find myself much more
inclined to work after talking to Paul Graham or Dan Connolly — they
just radiate energy. It’s tempting to think that you need to get away
from people and shut yourself off in your room to do any real work, but
this can be so demoralizing that it’s actually less efficient.

#### Share the load

Even if your friends aren’t cheerful, just working on a hard problem
with someone else makes it *much* easier. For one thing, the mental
weight gets spread across both people. For another, having someone else
there forces you to work instead of getting distracted.

#### Procrastination and the mental force field

But all of this is sort of dodging the issue. The real productivity
problem people have is procrastination. It’s something of a dirty little
secret, but *everyone* procrastinates — severely. It’s not just you. But
that doesn’t mean you shouldn’t try to stop it.

What is procrastination? To the outside observer, it looks like you’re
just doing something “fun” (like playing a game or reading the news)
instead of doing your actual work. (This usually causes the outside
observer to think you’re lazy and bad.) But the real question is: what’s
going on inside your head?

I’ve spent a bunch of time trying to explore this and the best way I can
describe it is that your brain puts up a sort of mental force field
around a task. Ever play with two magnets? If you orient the magnets
properly and try to push them towards each other, they’ll repel
fiercely. As you move them around, you can sort of feel out the edges of
the magnetic field. And as you try to bring the magnets together, the
field will push you back or off in another direction.

The mental block seems to work in the same way. It’s not particularly
solid or visible, but you can sort of feel it around the edges. And the
more you try to go towards it the more it pushes you away. And so, not
surprisingly, you end up going in another direction.^[3](#fn:s)^

And just as you can’t get two repelling magnets to sit together just by
pushing real hard — they’ll fling back as soon as you stop pushing —
I’ve never been able to overcome this mental force field through sheer
willpower. Instead, you have to be sneaky about it — you have to rotate
a magnet.

So what causes the mental force field? There appear to be two major
factors: whether the task is hard and whether it’s assigned.

##### Hard problems

###### Break it down

The first kind of hard problem is the problem that’s too big. Say you
want to build a recipe organizing program. Nobody can really just sit
down and build a recipe organizer. That’s a goal, not a task. A task is
a specific concrete step you can take towards your goal. A good first
task might be something like “draw a mockup of the screen that displays
a recipe”. Now that’s something you can do.^[4](#fn:nc)^

And when you do that, the next steps become clearer. You have to decide
what a recipe consists of, what kind of search features are needed, how
to structure the recipe database, and so on. You build up a momentum,
each task leading to the next. And as your brain gets crunching on the
subject, it becomes easier to solve that subject’s problems.

For each of my big projects, I think of all the tasks I can do next for
them and add them to my categorized todo list (see above). And when I
stop working on something, I add its next possible tasks to the todo
list.

###### Simplify it

Another kind of hard problem is the one that’s too complicated or
audacious. Writing a book seems daunting, so start by doing an essay. If
an essay is too much, start by writing a paragraph summary. The
important thing is to have something done right away.

Once you have something, you can judge it more accurately and understand
the problem better. It’s also much easier to improve something that
already exists than to work at a blank page. If your paragraph goes
well, then maybe it can grow into an essay and then into a book, little
by little, a perfectly reasonable piece of writing all the way through..

###### Think about it

Often the key to solving a hard problem will be getting some piece of
inspiration. If you don’t know much about the field, you should
obviously start by researching it — see how other people did things, get
a sense of the terrain. Sit and try and understand the field fully. Do
some smaller problems to see if you have a handle on it.

##### Assigned problems

Assigned problems are problems you’re told to work on. Numerous
psychology experiments have found that when you try to “incentivize”
people to do something, they’re less likely to do it and do a worse job.
External incentives, like rewards and punishments, kills what
psychologists call your “intrinsic motivation” — your natural interest
in the problem. (This is one of the most thoroughly replicated findings
of social psychology — over 70 studies have found that rewards undermine
interest in the task.)^[5](#fn:kohn)^ People’s heads seem to have a deep
avoidance of being told what to do.^[6](#fn:avo)^

The weird thing is that this phenomenon isn’t just limited to other
people — it even happens when you try to tell *yourself* what to do! If
you say to yourself, “I should really work on X, that’s the most
important thing to do right now” then all of the sudden X becomes the
toughest thing in the world to make yourself work on. But as soon as Y
becomes the most important thing, the exact same X becomes much easier.

###### Create a false assignment

This presents a rather obvious solution: if you want to work on X, tell
yourself to do Y. Unfortunately, it’s sort of difficult to trick
yourself intentionally, because you know you’re doing it.^[7](#fn:feyn)^
So you’ve got to be sneaky about it.

One way is to get someone else to assign something to you. The most
famous instance of this is grad students who are required to write a
dissertation, a monumentally difficult task that they need to do to
graduate. And so, to avoid doing this, grad students end up doing all
sorts of other hard stuff.

The task has to both seem important (you have to do this to graduate!)
and big (hundreds of pages of your best work!) but not actually be so
important that putting it off is going to be a disaster.

###### Don’t assign problems to yourself

It’s very tempting to say “alright, I need to put all this aside, hunker
down and finish this essay”. Even worse is to try to bribe yourself into
doing something, like saying “alright, if I just finish this essay then
I’ll go and eat some candy”. But the absolute worst of all is to get
someone else to try to force you to do something.

All of these are very tempting — I’ve done them all myself — but they’re
completely counterproductive. In all three cases, you’ve basically
assigned yourself a task. Now your brain is going to do everything it
can to escape it.

###### Make things fun

Hard work isn’t supposed to be pleasant, we’re told. But in fact it’s
probably the most enjoyable thing I do. Not only does a tough problem
completely absorb you while you’re trying to solve it, but afterwards
you feel wonderful having accomplished something so serious.

So the secret to getting yourself to do something is not to convince
yourself you have to do it, but to convince yourself that it’s fun. And
if it isn’t, then you need to make it fun.

I first got serious about this when I had to write essays for college.
Writing essays isn’t a particularly hard task, but it sure is assigned.
Who would voluntarily write a couple pages connecting the observations
of two random books? So I started making the essays into my own little
jokes. For one, I decided to write each paragraph in its own little
style, trying my best to imitate various forms of speech. (This had the
added benefit of padding things out.)^[8](#fn:ex)^

Another way to make things more fun is to solve the meta-problem.
Instead of building a web application, try building a web application
framework with this as the example app. Not only will the task be more
enjoyable, but the result will probably be more useful.

Conclusion
----------

There are a lot of myths about productivity — that time is fungible,
that focusing is good, that bribing yourself is effective, that hard
work is unpleasant, that procrastinating is unnatural — but they all
have a common theme: a conception of real work as something that goes
against your natural inclinations.

And for most people, in most jobs, this may be the case. There’s no
reason you should be inclined to write boring essays or file pointless
memos. And if society is going to force you to do so anyway, then you
need to learn to shut out the voices in your head telling you to stop.

But if you’re trying to do something worthwhile and creative, then
shutting down your brain is entirely the wrong way to go. The real
secret to productivity is the reverse: to listen to your body. To eat
when you’re hungry, to sleep when you’re tired, to take a break when
you’re bored, to work on projects that seem fun and interesting.

It seems all too simple. It doesn’t involve any fancy acronyms or
self-determination or personal testimonials from successful businessmen.
It almost seems like common sense. But society’s conception of work has
pushed us in the opposite direction. If we want to be more productive,
all we need to do is turn around.

Notes
-----

* * * * *

1.  Believe it or not, I actually have written in subways. It’s easy to
    come up with excuses as to why you’re not actually working — you
    don’t have enough time before your next appointment, people are
    making noise downstairs, etc. — but I find that when the inspiration
    strikes me, I can actually write stuff down on a subway car, where
    it’s absurdly loud and I only have a couple minutes before I have to
    get out and start walking. [↩](#fnref:sub)

2.  The same problem exists for sleep. There’s nothing worse than being
    too tired to go to bed — you just feel like a zombie. [↩](#fnref:t)

3.  Now it turns out I experience this same phenomenon in another area:
    shyness. I often don’t want to call a stranger up on the phone or go
    talk to someone at a party and I have the exact same mental field
    pushing me off in some other direction. I suspect this might be
    because shyness is also a trait that results from a problematic
    childhood. (See “Assigned problems”.) Of course, this is all very
    speculative. [↩](#fnref:s)

4.  While the terminology I use here (“next concrete step”) is derived
    from David Allen’s *Getting Things Done*, a lot of the principles
    here are (perhaps even unconsciously) applied in Extreme Programming
    (XP). Extreme Programming is presented as this system for keeping
    programs organized, but I find that a lot of it is actually good
    advice for avoid procrastination.

    For example, pair programming automatically spreads the mental
    weight of the task across two people as well as giving people
    something useful to do during lower-quality time. Breaking a project
    down into concrete steps is another key part of XP, as is getting
    something that works done right away and improving on it (“Simplify
    it” *infra*). And these are just the things that aren’t
    programming-specific. [↩](#fnref:nc)

5.  For a fantastic overview of the literature, see Alfie Kohn,
    *Punished By Rewards*. This specific claim is drawn from his article
    [Challenging Behaviorist Dogma: Myths About Money and
    Motivation](http://www.alfiekohn.org/managing/cbdmamam.htm). [↩](#fnref:kohn)

6.  I originally simply assumed this was somehow biological, but Paul
    Graham pointed out it’s more likely learned. When you’re little,
    your parents try their best to manipulate you. They say do your
    homework and your mind tries to wriggle free and think about
    something else. Soon enough the wriggling becomes habit. Either way,
    it’s going to be a tough problem to fix. I’ve given up trying to
    change this; now I try to work around it. [↩](#fnref:avo)

7.  Richard Feynman tells a story about how he was trying to explore his
    own dreams, much the way I’ve tried to explore my own
    procrastination. Each night, he’d try to observe what happened to
    himself as he fell asleep:

    > I’m dreaming one night as usual, making observations, … and then I
    > realize I’ve been sleeping with the back of my head against a
    > brass rod. I put my hand behind my head and I feel that the back
    > of my head is *soft*. I think, “Aha! That’s why I’ve been able to
    > make all these observations in my dreams: the brass rod has
    > disturbed my visual cortex. All I have to do is sleep with a brass
    > rod under my head and I can make these observations any time I
    > want. So I think I’ll stop making observations on this one and go
    > into deeper sleep.”
    >
    > When I woke up later, there was no brass rod, nor was the back of
    > my head soft. Somehow … my brain had invented false reasons as to
    > why I shouldn’t [observe my dreams] any more. (*Surely You’re
    > Joking, Mr. Feynman!*, 50)

    Your brain is a lot more powerful than you are. [↩](#fnref:feyn)

8.  So, for example, instead of writing “By contrast, Riis doesn’t quote
    many people.”, I wrote: “Riis, however, whether because of a
    personal deficit in the skill-based capacity required for collecting
    aurally-transmitted person-centered contemporaneous ethnographies
    into published paper-based informative accounts or simply a lack of
    preference for the reportage of community-located informational
    correspondents, demonstrates a total failure in producing a
    comparable result.”

    The professor, apparently seriously desensitized to bad writing,
    never seemed to realize I was joking (despite going over the paper
    with me one-on-one!). [↩](#fnref:ex)
