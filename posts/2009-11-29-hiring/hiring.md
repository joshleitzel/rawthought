There are three questions you have when you’re hiring a programmer (or
anyone, for that matter): Are they smart? Can they get stuff done? Can
you work with them? Someone who’s smart but doesn’t get stuff done
should be your friend, not your employee. You can talk your problems
over with them while they procrastinate on their actual job. Someone who
gets stuff done but isn’t smart is inefficient: non-smart people get
stuff done by doing it the hard way and working with them is slow and
frustrating. Someone you can’t work with, you can’t work with.

The traditional programmer hiring process consists of: a) reading a
resume, b) asking some hard questions on the phone, and c) giving them a
programming problem in person. I think this is a terrible system for
hiring people. You learn very little from a resume and people get real
nervous when you ask them tough questions in an interview. Programming
isn’t typically a job done under pressure, so seeing how people perform
when nervous is pretty useless. And the interview questions usually
asked seem chosen just to be cruel. I think I’m a pretty good
programmer, but I’ve never passed one of these interviews and I doubt I
ever could.

So when I hire people, I just try to answer the three questions. To find
out if they can get stuff done, I just ask what they’ve done. If someone
can actually get stuff done they should have done so by now. It’s hard
to be a good programmer without some previous experience and these days
anyone can get some experience by starting or contributing to a free
software project. So I just request a code sample and a demo and see
whether it looks good. You learn an enormous amount really quickly,
because you’re not watching them answer a contrived interview question,
you’re seeing their actual production code. Is it concise? clear?
elegant? usable? Is it something you’d want in your product?

To find out whether someone’s smart, I just have a casual conversation
with them. I do everything I can to take off any pressure off: I meet at
a cafe, I make it clear it’s not an interview, I do my best to be casual
and friendly. Under no circumstances do I ask them any standard
“interview questions” — I just chat with them like I would with someone
I met at a party. (If you ask people at parties to name their greatest
strengths and weaknesses or to estimate the number of piano tuners in
Chicago, you’ve got bigger problems.) I think it’s pretty easy to tell
whether someone’s smart in casual conversation. I constantly make
judgments about whether people I meet are smart, just like I constantly
make judgments about whether people I see are attractive.

But if I had to write down what it is that makes someone seem smart, I’d
emphasize three things. First, do they know stuff? Ask them [what
they’ve been thinking about](http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/smalltalkq)
and probe them about it. Do they seem to understand it in detail? Can
they explain it clearly? (Clear explanations are a sign of genuine
understanding.) Do they know stuff about the subject that you don’t?

Second, are they curious? Do they reciprocate by asking questions about
you? Are they genuinely interested or just being polite? Do they ask
follow-up questions about what you’re saying? Do their questions make
you think?

Third, do they learn? At some point in the conversation, you’ll probably
be explaining something to them. Do they actually understand it or do
they just nod and smile? There are people who know stuff about some
small area but aren’t curious about others. And there are people who are
curious but don’t learn, they ask lots of questions but don’t really
listen. You want someone who does all three.

Finally, I figure out whether I can work with someone just by hanging
out with them for a bit. Many brilliant people can seem delightful in a
one-hour conversation, but their eccentricities become grating after a
couple hours. So after you’re done chatting, invite them along for a
meal with the rest of the team or a game at the office. Again, keep
things as casual as possible. The point is just to see whether they get
on your nerves.

If all that looks good and I’m ready to hire someone, there’s a final
sanity check to make sure I haven’t been fooled somehow: I ask them to
do part of the job. Usually this means picking some fairly separable
piece we need and asking them to write it. (If you really insist on
seeing someone working under pressure, give them a deadline.) If
necessary, you can offer to pay them for the work, but I find most
programmers don’t mind being given a small task like this as long as
they can open source the work when they’re done. This test doesn’t work
on its own, but if someone’s passed the first three parts, it should be
enough to prove they didn’t trick you, they can actually do the work.

(I’ve known some people who say “OK, well why don’t we try hiring you
for a month and see how it goes.” This doesn’t seem to work. If you
can’t make up your mind after a small project you also can’t make it up
after a month and you end up hiring people who aren’t good enough.
Better to just say no and err on the side of getting better people.)

I’m fairly happy with this method. When I’ve skipped parts, I’ve ended
up with bad hires who eventually had to be let go. But when I’ve
followed it, I’ve ended up with people I like so much so that I actually
feel bad I don’t get to work with them anymore. I’m amazed that so many
companies use such silly hiring methods instead.
