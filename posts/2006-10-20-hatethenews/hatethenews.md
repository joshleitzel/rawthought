I Hate the News

* * * * *

Some people start their day by reading *The New York Times*. Others end
it by watching the nightly news. Some get it from *The Daily Show*.
Others download it from a variety weblogs. Some keep up-to-the-minute by
following CNN. Others have instant news updates automatically text
messaged to their phone. But everybody seems to agree: it’s a citizen’s
responsibility to keep up with the news. Everybody except me.

I think following the news is a waste of time.

Some people agree with me on a small scale. Some point out that the
cable channels are obsessed with bizarre crimes that have little larger
impact, that they worry too much about horse-race coverage of politics,
that too much of the news is filled with PR-inserted nonsense. But they
do this because they think these are aberrations; that underneath all
this, the news is worth saving. I simply go one step further: I think
none of it is worthwhile.

Let us look at the front page of today’s *New York Times*, the gold
standard in news. In the top spot there is a story about Republicans
feuding among themselves. There is a photo of soldiers in Iraq. A stock
exchange chief must return \$100M. There is a concern about some doctors
over-selling a nerve testing system. There is a threat from China
against North Korea. There is a report that violence in Iraq is rising.
And there is concern about virtual science classes replacing real ones.

None of these stories have relevance to my life. Reading them may be
enjoyable, but it’s an enjoyable waste of time. They will have no impact
on my actions one way or another.

Most people will usually generally concede this point, but suggest that
there’s something virtuous about knowing it anyway, that it makes me a
better citizen. They point out that newspapers are a key part of our
democracy, that by exposing wrong-doing to the people, they force the
wrong-doers to stop.

This seems to be true, but the curious thing is that I’m never involved.
The government commits a crime, the *New York Times* prints it on the
front page, the people on the cable chat shows foam at the mouth about
it, the government apologizes and commits the crime more subtly. It’s a
valuable system — I certainly support the government being more subtle
about committing crimes (well, for the sake of argument, at least) — but
you notice how it never involves me? It seems like the whole thing would
work just as well even if nobody ever read the *Times* or watched the
cable chat shows. It’s a closed system.

There is voting, of course, but to become an informed voter all one
needs to do is read a short guide about the candidates and issues before
the election. There’s no need to have to suffer through the daily
back-and-forth of allegations and counter-allegations, of scurrilous
lies and their refutations. Indeed, reading a voter’s guide is much
better: there’s no recency bias (where you only remember the crimes
reported in the past couple months), you get to hear both sides of the
story after the investigation has died down, you can actually think
about the issues instead of worrying about the politics.

Others say that sure, most of the stuff in the news isn’t of use, but
occasionally you’ll come across some story that will lead you to
actually change what you’ve been working on. But really, how plausible
is this? Most people’s major life changes don’t come from reading an
article in the newspaper; they come from reading longer-form essays or
thoughtful books, which are much more convincing and detailed.

Which brings me to my second example of people agreeing with me on the
small scale. You’ll often hear TV critics say that CNN’s
up-to-the-minute reporting is absurd. Instead of saying, “We have
unconfirmed reports that—This just in! We now have confirmed reports
that those unconfirmed reports have been denied. No, wait! There’s a new
report denying the confirmation of the denial of the unconfirmed
report.” and giving viewers whiplash, they suggest that the reporters
simply wait until a story is confirmed before reporting it and do
commentary in the meantime.

But if that’s true on a scale of minutes, why longer? Instead of
watching hourly updates, why not read a daily paper? Instead of reading
the back and forth of a daily, why not read [a weekly
review](http://harpers.org/WeeklyReview.html)? Instead of a weekly
review, why not read a monthly magazine? Instead of a monthly magazine,
why not read an annual book?

With the time people waste reading a newspaper every day, they could
have read an entire book about most subjects covered and thereby learned
about it with far more detail and far more impact than the daily doses
they get dribbled out by the paper. But people, of course, wouldn’t read
a book about most subjects covered in the paper, because most of them
are simply irrelevant.

But finally, I’d like to argue that following the news isn’t just a
waste of time, it’s actively unhealthy. Edward Tufte notes that when he
used to read the *New York Times* in the morning, it scrambled his brain
with so many different topics that he couldn’t get any real intellectual
work done the rest of the day.

The news’s obsession with having a little bit of information on a wide
variety of subjects means that it actually gets most of those subjects
wrong. (One need only read the blatant errors reported in the
corrections page to get some sense of the more thorough-going errors
that must lie beneath them. And, indeed, anyone who has ever been in the
news will tell you that the news always gets the story wrong.) Its
obsession with the criminal and the deviant makes us less trusting
people. Its obsession with the hurry of the day-to-day makes us less
reflective thinkers. Its obsession with surfaces makes us shallow.

This is not simply an essay meant to provoke; I genuinely believe what I
write. I have not followed the news at least since I was 13 (with
occasional lapses on particular topics). My life does not seem to be
impoverished for it; indeed, I think it has been greatly enhanced. But I
haven’t found many other people who are willing to take the plunge.
