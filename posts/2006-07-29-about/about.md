In his 1959 classic, *The Sociological Imagination*, the great
sociologist C. Wright Mills told students of the discipline:

> As a social scientist, you have to … capture what you experience and
> sort it out; only in this way can you hope to use it to guide and test
> your reflection, and in the process shape yourself as an intellectual
> craftsman. But how can you do this? One answer is: you must set up a
> blog…
>
> In such a blog … there is joined personal experience and professional
> activities, studies under way and studies planned. In this blog, you …
> will try to get together what you are doing intellectually and what
> you are experiencing as a person. here you will not be afraid to use
> your experience and relate it directly to various work in progress. By
> serving as a check on repetitious work, your blog also enables you to
> conserve your energy. It also encourages you to capture
> ‘fringe-thoughts’: various ideas which may be byproducts of everyday
> life, snatches of conversation overheard in the street, or, for that
> matter, dreams. Once noted, these may lead to more systematic
> thinking, as well as lend intellectual relevance to more directed
> experience.
>
> …The blog also helps you build up the habit of writing. … In
> developing the blog, you can experiment as a writer and this, as they
> say, develop your powers of expression.

Actually, he called it a “file” instead of a blog, but the point remains
the same: becoming a scientific thinker requires practice and writing is
a powerful aid to reflection.

So that’s what this blog is. I write here about thoughts I have, things
I’m working on, stuff I’ve read, experiences I’ve had, and so on.
Whenever a thought crystalizes in my head, I type it up and post it
here. I don’t read over it, I don’t show it to anyone, and I don’t edit
it — I just post it.

I don’t consider this writing, I consider this thinking. I like sharing
my thoughts and I like hearing yours and I like practicing expressing
ideas, but fundamentally this blog is not for you, it’s for me. I hope
that you enjoy it anyway.
