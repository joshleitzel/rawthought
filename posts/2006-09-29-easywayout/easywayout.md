Take the Easy Way Out

When I was a kid, people were always telling me that there was no
substitute for hard work. If I wanted to be smart, I had to sit and
force myself to read hard books. If I wanted to lose weight, I had to
force myself to exercise. If I wanted to play piano, I had to force
myself away from the computer to practice. Cheating, they explained,
would only cheat myself in the end.

And yet today I eagerly ran to the library to grab five large books (and
return seven more), felt an itch to go jogging, and walked away from web
surfing so I could go practice a musical instrument. The adults were
completely wrong.

Your body’s resistance to an activity isn’t an obstacle to be overcome,
it’s a message that you’re being an idiot, just like when your hand
hurts after you punch a wall. The right solution isn’t to start punching
the wall harder, it’s to look around for a tool to help you do the job.

In the case of books, the key is that you need to be sure to read books
that are at your level. If you read books about subjects you don’t know
enough to understand or that use a dialect you’re not familiar with,
it’s going to be hard and it’s going to be a waste of time. With losing
weight, the key is things like the Shangri-La Diet. And with learning an
instrument, the key is using [Bemani
games](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bemani) that actually make music
fun.

I’ve discussed the other two in other places, but why do Bemani games
work? First, you’re playing real music. Normally when you play piano,
you have to start on baby songs which are both infantilizing and
uninteresting, with real music not even on the horizon. Bemani games
start you on real songs from the beginning. Since the reason many people
get excited about musical instruments in the first place is the chance
to play their favorite song, this is a pretty compelling difference. And
the fact that the computer simplifies the song and fills in the notes
you don’t play for you makes it possible.

Second, Bemani games provide clear additional results in proportion to
additional effort. This is what makes them so much fun. I don’t know
about the real science, but in Barbara Ehrenreich’s novel *Kipper’s
Game* the plot revolves around some research showing that games like
that stimulate the pleasure centers of the brain. You get the high of
achievement, but it quickly wears off as you get used to your new skill
level, and so you want to do better so you can get another high.

This is also what makes these games so educational. Research on experts
has found such immediate feedback is essential to learning, calling the
general process “deliberate practice”. In deliberate practice, “subjects
should receive immediate informative feedback and knowledge of results
of their performance. The subjects should repeatedly perform the same or
similar tasks. When these conditions are met, practice improves accuracy
and speed of performance on cognitive, perceptual, and motor tasks
(Fitts & Posner, 1967; Gibson, 1969; Welford, 1968).” (K. Anders
Ericsson, et. al, “[The Role of Deliberate
Practice](http://www.freakonomics.com/pdf/DeliberatePractice(PsychologicalReview).pdf)”,
*Psychological Review*) Your attempts aren’t random — it’s very clear
what works and what doesn’t and you can adjust your strategies
accordingly.

Third, you can do them in small chunks. When you normally play an
instrument, if you hit a wrong note you often keep trying until you get
it right. But with Bemani games, the music just keeps marching on
without you. This might at first seem a disadvantage, but it means you
don’t get hung up on a mistake, each attempt takes at most as long the
song does. With real music, if you hit a difficult part of the song you
can easily get stuck trying over and over to get it right, before
getting frustrated and giving up on the whole thing. Keeping the music
moving forces you to look at the bigger picture.

The flip side of this is that playing the games gives you a continuous
sense of motion and progress. In the mid-1980s — the heyday of video
game research — some psychologists were trying to find out what video
games quite so much fun. They took the classic Wozniak/Atari game
[Breakout](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breakout) and started removing
components to see if kids stopped playing it. What they found was you
could remove just about everything — the levels, the score, the bouncing
off the paddle — everything except for the animations of the bricks
disappearing. It was making the bricks disappear, somehow, that made the
game fun. (Mind at Play, Loftus and Loftus)

I doubt Bemani games were made with these kind of principles in mind —
considering the history, it was probably just a coincidence. But it
shows that you could have created Bemani from them. All you needed to do
was pay attention to the fact that learning an instrument was
frustrating and tried to eliminate the frustrating part. Good designers,
when they see people having trouble using something they designed, don’t
tell the user to try harder. They fix the design. We should take the
same attitude when we design our life as well.
