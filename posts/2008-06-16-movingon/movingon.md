Moving On

In November 2006, I moved to San Francisco because I had to: my company
got acquired and us moving out was a condition of the agreement. It was
the first time I’d ever actually lived in San Francisco, as opposed to
just visiting, and I quickly realized that although it was a fun place
to visit, I couldn’t stand living here.

Even after all this time, I can’t really put my finger on what it is I
don’t like — in fact, I suspect it’s probably harder for me now to
explain it than it was when I first came here. The first thing that
comes to mind is how *loud* the city is. I want a place where I can live
quietly and focus on my work; but San Francisco is filled with
distractions. There are always crews tearing up the street, trains that
are delayed, buses that have broken down, homeless people begging,
friends having parties, and so on. It’s impossible to concentrate and
without my concentration, I feel less like me.

The other big problem is that San Francisco is fairly shallow. When I go
to coffee shops or restaurants I can’t avoid people talking about load
balancers or databases. The conversations are boring and obsessed with
technical trivia, or worse, business antics. I don’t see people reading
books — even at the library, all the people are in line for the computer
terminals or the DVD rack — and people at parties seem uninterested in
intellectual conversation.

And so I’m moving back to Cambridge, Massachusetts — Harvard Square in
particular, the one place I’ve ever been to that brings a special
delight to my eyes, that warms my heart just to see. Surrounded by
Harvard and MIT and Tufts and BC and BU and on and on it’s a city of
thinking and of books, of quiet contemplation and peaceful
concentration. And it has actual weather, with real snow and seasons and
everything, not this time-stands-still sun that San Francisco insists
upon.

I miss Boston; I’m excited to go back.

But I’m also sad to leave my responsibilities in San Francisco. One of
which I’d particularly like your help with. I’ve been honored and
overjoyed to help Lawrence Lessig get his [Change
Congress](http://change-congress.org/) project off the ground. If you
haven’t heard, he’s trying to build a national movement to get the
corruption out of Congress; to pass public financing of public
elections, earmark reform, and other pressing concerns.

But they need a full-time day-to-day tech organizer. Someone who knows
how to blog and who the bloggers are and can keep them in touch with the
community. Someone who knows enough about technology to know the tools
that can be built and should be. And someone with enough drive and
talent to make sure those things get built. It’s a dreamy job and I hope
there’s someone out there who will take it from me. [A more formal

is on the Change Congress blog.

Thanks for everything.
