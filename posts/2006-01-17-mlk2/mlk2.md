> I must confess that over the past few years I have been gravely

> stride toward freedom is not the White Citizen’s Councilor or the Ku
> Klux Klanner, but the white moderate, who is more devoted to “order”
> than to justice; who prefers a negative peace which is the absence of
> tension to a positive peace which is the presence of justice; who
> constantly says: “I agree with you in the goal you seek, but I cannot
> agree with your methods of direct action”; who paternalistically
> believes he can set the timetable for another man’s freedom; who lives
> by a mythical concept of time and who constantly advises the Negro to
> wait for a “more convenient season.”
